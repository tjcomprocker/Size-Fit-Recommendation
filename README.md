# Size Fit Recommendation
Product returns takes major hit on revenue for any Online Marketplace. So if we could reduce number of product returns then that would in turn increase the revenue generated by that Online Marketplace. Out of all the product returns that happened in Flipkart in last year, about 54.7% were in Lifestyle Products alone. And one of the major reason for these returns is “size/fit issue”. So if we could generate a confidence score about how well a product fits the customer, based on their previous sales/returns data and sales/returns data of similar users then that could potentially reduce number of product returns in Lifestyle Products category in E-Commerce.

This Repo contains code written during my internship @Flipkart.
